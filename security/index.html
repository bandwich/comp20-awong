Javascript injection



Introduction

Methodology
First did black box testing using curl
Then read the source code of my partner’s assignment 3.

Abstract of Findings
Found vulnerability in data input - the website is not protected against a redirection
Vulnerability in displaying user data - input can be manipulated to show all user data

Issues found
Javascript injection
sendLocation API
High - the website no longer displays at all and can be changed to display anything
Description - found that the request parameters will accept javascript
	
Proof
Resolution - check parameters for javascript (special characters, <> tags)
To fix, remove mongoDB entry with javascript

MongoDB injection
Checkins.json API
High - all user data and location is publicly displayed on the site
Description - found that mongoDB will show all data except the query provided
http://salty-brook-32366.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=ymOsHX1N

Proof
Resolution
Check data for more than one login, and don’t send it if so (user should never be able to get data from more than one login)

Conclusion
Every instance where the user can input something has to be extensively checked to make sure the user can’t do anything they’re not supposed to
