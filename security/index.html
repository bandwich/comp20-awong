	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The goal is to find and document as many vulnerabilities and flaws with my partner's work. I can use whatever means necessary to do so. The project I am testing for flaws is a map that displays checkins by users. The user data, such as name, location, and date checked in, is all in the database.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>I first did black box testing using curl. Then I read the source code of my partner’s assignment 3 and used that to search for additional vulnerabilities.</p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
		<h3>Issue #1</h3>
			<p>Issue: Javascript injection</p>
			<p>Location: sendLocation API</p>
			<p>Severity: High</p>
			<p>Description of issue: The request parameters for sendLocation will accept JavaScript.</p>
				<img src="JsInjection.jpg" alt="JS">
			<p>Proof of vulnerability: </p>
				<img src="reddit.jpg">
			<p>Resolution: Check request parameters for special characters such as tags. To fix the issue, delete the entry from mongoDB.</p>
		<h3>Issue #2</h3>
			<p>Issue: MongoDB injection</p>
			<p>Location: checkins.json API</p>
			<p>Severity: High</p>
			<p>Description of issue: Found that mongoDB can show all data except the query provided using login[$ne]</p>
			<p>Proof of vulnerability: </p>
				<img src="mongoDBInjection.jpg" alt="mongo">
			<p>Resolution: Check data for more than one login, and don’t send it if so (user should never be able to get data from 	more than one login)</p>
		<h3>Issue #3</h3>
			<p>Issue: XSS Vulnerability</p>
			<p>Location: sendLocation API</p>
			<p>Severity: High</p>
			<p>Description of issue: The request parameters for sendLocation will accept JavaScript, and thus the site can be changed to display anything.</p>

			<p>Resolution: Check request parameters for special characters such as tags. To fix the issue, delete the entry from mongoDB.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Every instance where the user can input something has to be extensively checked to make sure the user can’t do anything they’re not supposed to. This is in regards to both the mongo database and the server itself.</p>
